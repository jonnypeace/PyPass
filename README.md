# PyPass

**PyPass** is a command-line password manager built with Python, leveraging modern libraries like `polars`, `rich`, and `prompt_toolkit` to provide a secure and user-friendly interface for managing passwords locally.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Secure Storage**: Encrypt and store passwords locally using `cryptography`.
- 🧭 **Interactive CLI**: Navigate your password vault with an intuitive interface.
- 🔍 **Search**: Quickly find entries using fuzzy search.
- 📋 **Clipboard Integration**: Copy credentials securely via `pyclip`.
- 🧪 **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux and Windows.

## 🚀 Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonnypeace/PyPass.git
cd PyPass
pip install .
```

### From github versions

Download the windows exe, or the python pyz.

To run the pyz...

```bash
python pypass.pyz
```

The windows exe will run as it.

## 🛠 Usage

After installation, simply run:

```bash
pypass
```

The CLI will guide you through navigating, searching, copying, and managing your stored credentials.

> The UI is fully interactive, using arrow keys, fuzzy search, and prompt-toolkit widgets.

## 🧩 Configuration

`pypass.conf` is created and used to store settings. The database (`py_pass.db`) is encrypted and kept locally.
